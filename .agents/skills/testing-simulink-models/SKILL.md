# Simulink Gherkin Tests

This copy is adapted for `simulink-mcp-server`. The MathWorks Agentic Toolkit `model_test` tool is not included. Prefer source-visible MATLAB test files run with `matlab_run_tests`; when Simulink Test is installed, use `matlab_execute_code` with documented Simulink Test APIs to create harnesses and test cases.

Simulink Test is optional but recommended for subsystem harness workflows. If unavailable, use `simulating-simulink-models` with manual assertions in MATLAB tests.

Use this skill when you need persistent, reusable pass/fail verification of model behavior.

## Syntax Reference

If the user already has the MathWorks `model_test` tool configured, the Gherkin format below is compatible with that workflow. Otherwise translate scenarios into MATLAB test methods or Simulink Test API calls and run them with `matlab_run_tests`.

```gherkin
# --- front-matter:toml ---                # REQUIRED: exactly one, must be first in file
model = "Model.slx"                        # model filename with .slx extension
component = "Model/Subsystem"              # optional; default = model name without .slx
[inputs]                                   # alias = "portReference" for each input port
Speed = "Speed"                            # scalar port: just the port name
Torque = "'Torque (Nm)'"                   # single quotes if name contains ( ) or .
Pos = "Position(2)"                        # vector element: "PortName(N)"
Cmd = "Control.Throttle"                   # bus element: "PortName.Element"
[outputs]                                  # alias = "portReference" for each output port
Output = "Output"                          # scalar port
Force = "'Force (N)'"                      # single-quoted scalar port
Yaw = "'Rate (deg/s)'.Filtered(2)"         # single-quoted port with vectorized bus element
# --- end front-matter ---                 # markers must be exact as shown

Feature: Descriptive title                 # exactly one Feature, colon required directly after keyword
  Description text here.                   # descriptions cannot start with keywords; prefix * to escape

Scenario: Unique scenario title            # at least one Scenario, unique titles, colon required
  Description of test case.
  Given inputs                             # exactly one Given; MUST have * line for EVERY declared input
    * Speed = const(50)                    # const(<value>)
    * Torque = step(0 -> 100 @ 1s)         # step(<from> -> <to> @ <time>)  time: Ns or Nms
  When simulate for 5s in Normal mode      # EXACT syntax; duration: Ns or Nms (>0); mode: Normal|SIL
  Then baseline "ref.mat" with tolerances: absTol=0.01, relTol=0.01, timeTol=50ms
    * Output: absTol=0.001                 # per-signal tolerance override; defaults are 0
  Then outputs                             # 1-2 Then blocks allowed (baseline and/or outputs)
    * Positive: Output > 0                 # operators: == != < > <= >=  (never vs another signal)
    * Bounded: Output == [10 .. 90]        # ranges with == only: [a..b] (a..b) [a..b) (a..b]
    * Settled: Output > 80 when t > 3s     # conditional: when t <op> <time>
    * InRange: Output == (0 .. 100]        # assessment names must be unique
```

## Description Line Escape

```gherkin
# ❌ WRONG - starts with keyword:
  When input changes, output responds
# ✅ Rephrase:
  If input changes, output responds
# ✅ Or escape with *:
  * When input changes, output responds
```

## Best Practice

Prefer subsystem component-level tests—top level models can be large and slow to update/test, while subsystem components offer faster iteration, isolation, and clearer failure diagnosis. Use judgment based on what you're verifying.

The component under test must not contain physical modeling ports (PMIOPort / Simscape Connection Port blocks). Only components with standard Simulink Inport/Outport interfaces are supported. If the subsystem you want to test has physical ports, test a parent subsystem that wraps it with signal-based I/O instead.

If the model contains Simscape elements, set the model parameter `SimscapeLogType` to `"none"` before running tests. Simscape logging can interfere with test harness signal routing. This is a one-time model configuration, not a simulation command. Use: `set_param('ModelName', 'SimscapeLogType', 'none')`.

## Directory Warning

Don't change MATLAB's working directory while a model is open. Test harness cache is directory-tied—changing it causes stale harness errors.
